# Learning Python Journey

Welcome to the "Learning Python Journey" folder within my Data Science Learning Repository! üåêüêç

## Introduction
This folder is dedicated to documenting my progress in mastering Python, specifically focusing on enhancing my skills in working with files and input/output operations. Each project represents a step forward in my journey to become proficient in handling file-related tasks using Python.

## Project Structure
- The projects are organized in subfolders based on their complexity and topic.
- Each subfolder contains a Python script or a collection of scripts related to file I/O concepts or projects.

## How to Explore
1. Navigate to the desired subfolder to explore a particular project.
2. Open the Python script to view the code and comments.
3. Feel free to provide feedback, suggestions, or improvements.

## Projects List
1. **File I/O Mastery Exercise**

   Description:
   This Python script focuses on generating multiplication tables from 2 to 20 and saving them in individual text files. The goal is to practice and improve file I/O skills in Python.

   Usage:
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system.
   - Run the script (`2_20.py`) to generate multiplication tables.
   - Check the 'tables' directory for individual files containing the tables.

   Note:
   - If encountering issues, check permissions and adjust file paths as needed.

## Contribution
If you have ideas for improvement, bug fixes, or would like to collaborate on a file I/O project, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request. I welcome contributions from the community to enhance the quality of these Python projects.
