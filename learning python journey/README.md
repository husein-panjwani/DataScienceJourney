# Learning Python Journey

Welcome to the "Learning Python Journey" folder within my Data Science Learning Repository! üåêüêç

## Introduction
This folder is dedicated to documenting my progress in mastering Python, ranging from basic to advanced concepts. Each project represents a step forward in my journey to become proficient in this versatile programming language.

## Project Structure
- The projects are organized in subfolders based on their complexity and topic.
- Each subfolder contains a Python script or a collection of scripts related to a specific concept or project.

## How to Explore
1. Navigate to the desired subfolder to explore a particular project.
2. Open the Python script to view the code and comments.
3. Feel free to provide feedback, suggestions, or improvements.

## Projects List
1. **Basic Python Shopping Bill Calculator**
   Description:
This Python project serves as a basic shopping bill calculator to practice fundamental programming concepts.
It allows users to input the price of items and calculates the total bill.
If the user inputs 'q', it finalizes the bill, provides change if necessary, and ends the transaction.
 This project is ideal for beginners looking to strengthen their Python skills and understanding of basic arithmetic operations.

Problem Statement:
Create a Python program that acts as a simple shopping bill calculator. 
The program should prompt the user to enter the price of each item and keep a running total of the bill.
When the user inputs 'q', the program should finalize the bill, ask for the amount of money the customer gave, and calculate the change if necessary. 
Ensure error handling for incorrect inputs.
